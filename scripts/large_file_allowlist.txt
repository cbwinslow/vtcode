# Patterns listed here are exempt from the large file threshold enforced by
# scripts/check_large_files.py. Use glob syntax relative to the repository root.
# Lines starting with `#` and blank lines are ignored.
#
# To apply a custom size ceiling instead of a full exemption, append
# `=max_bytes` to the pattern. Underscores are allowed for readability.
# Examples:
#   docs/models.json
#   **/fixtures/*.gif
#   docs/screenshots/*.png=600_000
